# What is Web 
Development and How does it work?

Web development, also known as website development, refers to the work associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser.

Web developers \[Persons whose task is to do web development\] do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depend on the types of tasks they are performing and the platforms on which they are working.

The field of web development is commonly broken down into the ***Front-end*** part (the user-facing side), the ***Back-end*** part (the server side), and those who manage all aspects of a website (“full stack).

### •Difference between Front-end & Back-end Development

**FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT:-** Front-end web development, also known as client-side or user-facing side development.

To do this front-end developer uses three main languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming. What you see and what you use, such as the visual aspect of the website, the drop-down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end developers, who write a series of programs to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. These programs are run through a browser.

Front-end developers work hand in hand with UI designers. They are the person who implements all the ideas into reality and makes responsive designs on the website. They make sure that the website opens correctly in various browsers on various devices same and smoothly in an organised manner for the user.

Front-end frameworks are JavaScript libraries (with CSS and Bootstrap components) that assist you in creating a website, web app, or mobile app. Front End Frameworks make it much easier for developers to build the user interfaces of their web and mobile apps as web development evolves.

**BACKEND DEVELOPMENT:-** Back-end developers are the ones who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites.

This is where the data is stored, and without this data, there would be no front end. The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data. The backend developer uses computer programs to ensure that the server, the application and the database run smoothly together. This type of developer needs to analyse what a company’s needs are and provide efficient programming solutions.

To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, like PHP, RUBY, PYTHON, JAVA and others. These are used to create logical functionality of a website or an application to handle the processing of data and communicate with the database.

Back-end developers use frameworks like Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring, and Express.js, to make development more efficient and effective.

Backend developers also use databases such as MySQL, and MongoDB to store and retrieve data. They work hand in hand with a front-end developer to insure that the website or an app functions properly.

They also work with the database manager so that data is properly stored and retrieved properly when in need and make sure it is properly optimised.

**FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT:-** Full-stackers take care of both the front-end side and the back-end side, and need to know how the web works on all levels, to determine how the client- and server-sides will relate.
