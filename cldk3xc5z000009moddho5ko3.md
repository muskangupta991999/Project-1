# Most Useful Tools Every Aspiring Developer Must Know

Hello Folks, ðŸ‘‹

As an aspiring developer, it's essential to have a strong understanding of the tools you'll be using in your day-to-day work.

Here are some of the most important tools you should familiarize yourself with :

**1-Visual Studio Code**: A free, open-source, cross-platform source code editor developed by Microsoft that supports multiple programming languages and has a vast library of extensions. Itâ€™s so great because you can customize it to your liking with all the available extensions. It doesnâ€™t matter what you are doing, from web development to mobile or using languages like Javascript, Python etc. There are so many extensions for you to cater the app to anything you do. Here are some of my favourite extensions are Live Server, Prettier, CSS Peek, JavaScript ES6 Code Snippets, etc.

Git also enables you to keep track of different versions of the codebase, making it easy to revert to a previous version if needed.
