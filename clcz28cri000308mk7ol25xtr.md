# Everything you need to know about ChatGPT

Nowadays almost everyone must have heard somewhere the most sensational word ChatGPT and they must have been wondering what is ChatGPT and how it works. This blog will help you to understand the basic idea of ChatGPT.

### ‚Ä¢*What is ChatGPT*?

ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models.

It is a new Artificial Intelligence tool that can comprehend and generate natural language or human text. It is designed to allow people to have conversations. It can answer or talk with you. It's like a virtual robot ü§ñ that can help many people to simplify their work.

### ‚Ä¢ *What does it do*?

ChatGPT, like most AIs, is trained from a large amount of data and deep learning from the Internet. ChatGPT has a conversational interface that allows it to respond to follow-up questions, reject requests, and recognize when it has made an error or miscalculated. It is also easy to use.

In other words, it is nothing more than a model that is being trained by humans and powered by AI, and based on the inputs and feedback, it changes its pattern and responds accordingly. OpenAI stated in a statement that this model works on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or RLHF that can reject inappropriate inputs, train themselves to provide the best solution and answer all the users‚Äô queries.

### ‚Ä¢ *How to use ChatGPT?*

Since its initial release, the company has seen a surge in users and the number of registered users crossed 1 million (that too in just 4 days).

Let's learn step by step:-

STEP 1:

Open the official website [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) then click on try ChatGPT to begin your journey.

STEP 2:

A new window will then appear on your screen and you‚Äôll be asked to LOG IN or SIGNUP to start

STEP 3:

You will be then redirected to the main page, and you‚Äôll find a small tour guide.

You will be able to see a screen with multiple options that you can do with ChatGPT, with a small chat box in the bottom line.

STEP 4:

Now you can interact with ChatGPT and ask away what you want to ask. That's it.

### ‚Ä¢**Limitations of ChatGPT**

ChatGPT is not perfect, but it does look impressive. ChatGPT‚Äôs limitations include the inability to correctly answer specific questions, which means that it will need to be rewritten to make the input question understandable.

The list of limitations is long when using ChatGPT, however, I have focused on providing the main differences that can be fixed in the upcoming future.

Have a look at some of the limitations below:

1-No real-time output

2-External support from any URL (for reference) is not allowed

3-The location-based facility is still missing

4-There are cases where ChatGPT was unable to answer basic riddles.

In most cases, it has been observed that ChatGPT is lagging and needs improvements. Till, that time, the company is targeting to work towards making their AI-based system more convenient.

### ‚Ä¢**How ChatGPT is being used by people**?

For finding FunFacts. For learning something new. For explaining how things work. For help in Coding. For poetry. And many other things

### ‚Ä¢**Will ChatGPT take jobs**?

Well, this question is all over the internet that ChatGPT will take your jobs, and makes you unemployed so let's see is it really like that?

Well, the concept of ChatGPT is so unique that it gained popularity in a matter of no time. But, since it‚Äôs in a new phase and there are tons of work required to generate quality output. So, the answer is ‚ÄúNO‚Äù it‚Äôs not going to take jobs in the upcoming years.

### ‚Ä¢*Conclusion: ChatGPT is a Good Thing or a Bad Thing?*

ChatGPT, a highly advanced chatbot, has the potential to simplify people‚Äôs lives and assist them with tedious tasks such as sending emails or searching the internet for answers, enhancing customer engagement. To prevent misinformation from spreading, certain technical details must be clarified before ChatGPT can be widely used. **AI and ML** models require a lot of training and fine-tuning to achieve an ideal level of performance.

Is this a sign that AI is taking control of the world? Although it is possible that AI may not be taking over the world yet, OpenAI‚Äôs Altman believes that AI with human-like intelligence is within reach. Altman tweeted in response to Musk‚Äôs comments about AI being dangerously powerful: ‚ÄúI agree that AI is close to dangerously strong AI in the sense that an AI which poses e.g. This is a significant cybersecurity risk. I believe we could reach real AGI within the next decade. So we must also take that risk seriously.‚Äù

He noted that it was also interesting to see people debate whether AI systems should behave the way their creators want. The question of which values these systems should be aligned to will be one the most important issues society has ever faced.‚Äù

Intelligent chatbots that have been trained to engage and converse with humans. OpenAI claims that ChatGPT can respond to any type of writing using the dialogue model. This includes mathematical solutions and theoretical essays. In addition, the company claims that ChatGPT can answer any follow-up questions, and can admit to making mistakes
